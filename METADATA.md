  * **Source:** Created from the 2016 Census TIGER area water shapefile for Madison County, Illinois.
  * **Modifications:** Island features were created by converting the original shapefile to polyline data and then back to polygon data. This created polygons for each island where there had only been "donut holes" beforehand. Non-island features were then deleted from the shapefile.
